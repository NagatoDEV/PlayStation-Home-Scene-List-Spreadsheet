The purpose of this repository is to keep an archive of all of the scenes that has been obtained by the [Destination Home Team](http://destinationho.me/). This includes public, private, and development scenes from all regions of home (SCEA/SCEE/SCEJ/SCEAsia). 

* For the **Public/Personal** space scene list click [here](https://github.com/NagatoDEV/PlayStation-Home-Scene-List-Spreadsheet/blob/main/Destination%20Home%20Archive%20Public-Private%20Scene%20List.csv). Moreover, if you want to see our current archive of *rare* development home spaces check out this [spreadsheet](https://github.com/NagatoDEV/PlayStation-Home-Scene-List-Spreadsheet/blob/main/Destination%20Home%20Archive%20Development%20Scene%20List.csv).

* To see what current spaces that the Destination Home Team is missing you can view our **missing scene list spreadsheet** [here](https://github.com/NagatoDEV/PlayStation-Home-Scene-List-Spreadsheet/blob/main/Destination%20Home%20Archive%20Public-Private%20Scene%20List.csv).

## Additional Information ℹ️

This archive will be updated whenever the team gains more scenes from users cache donations.
