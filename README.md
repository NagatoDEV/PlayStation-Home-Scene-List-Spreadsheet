The purpose of this repository is to keep an archive of all of the scenes that has been obtained by the [Destination Home Team](http://destinationho.me/). This includes public, private, and development scenes from all regions of home (SCEA/SCEE/SCEJ/SCEAsia). 

* For the **Public/Personal** space scene list click [here](https://github.com/NagatoDEV/PlayStation-Home-Scene-List-Spreadsheet/blob/main/Destination%20Home%20Archive%20Public-Private%20Scene%20List.csv). Moreover, if you want to see our current archive of *rare* development home spaces check out this [spreadsheet](https://github.com/NagatoDEV/PlayStation-Home-Scene-List-Spreadsheet/blob/main/Destination%20Home%20Archive%20Development%20Scene%20List.csv).

* To see what current spaces that the Destination Home Team is missing you can view our **missing scene list spreadsheet** [here](https://github.com/NagatoDEV/PlayStation-Home-Scene-List-Spreadsheet/blob/main/Destination%20Home%20Archive%20Public-Private%20Scene%20List.csv).

# Additional Information:

This archive will be updated whenever the team gains more data i.e, obtaining more scenes.

## How can you help out the project?

Currently our development team is looking for anyone who still has PlayStation Home on there PS3 console, any data we can obtain can help the preservation for home. Our primary goal is to get Home back running online. So our team has been working on trying to emulate Sony's Medius server via using the PlayStation 3 CFW & RPCS3.

For more information on how to donate cache data please refer to this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BppPWh49ROU&feature=youtu.be) Alternatively you can check out my written version of this guide [here](https://gist.github.com/NagatoDEV/587b5a76a1789a9d91c48e87c634771b).
